# first_web_scraper
Just for learning purposes and also preparation for some other stuff.

Takes data from sites that sell GPU's and exports it to csv file.
Needs to be run manually because I haven't figured out how to do this yet :(

All data collected so far is from newegg. But I got caught using script so can't continue this anymore
